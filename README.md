# Some Credit:-
This project is done with the help of a video from "Sourav Johar" youtbe channel. The link for the video is :-
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uSA3xyXlwM&t=538s . In the video he has created a system to play Rock,Paper,Scissor game. I used the same concept and build this program.
 
 # About this program:-
 This program is written so that the user can play most of the racing games using their hand gestures. This program uses a pre trained Squeezenet model. I have only used three keys - Down, Left and Right in the game but you can use as many as you can to train the model.
